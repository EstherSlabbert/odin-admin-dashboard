# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard

This project is my solution for the Odin Project: Admin Dashboard project with instructions found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). It focuses on using a grid layout for a basic non-responsive admin dashboard UI.

**Design supported by Webkit (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera)**. Firefox, Internet Explorer & Edge are not supported (need to change scrollbar pseudo-classes).

**Optimal design minimum screen width compatability: 1160px**.
